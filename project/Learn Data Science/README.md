# Learn with SherlockML
Whether you are a seasoned data scientist or you are completely new to data science, we hope that you will find the learning resources which we have integrated into Sherlock useful. In this folder, you will find a set of notebooks that take you through various aspects of data science. Here is a brief summary of each folder:

1. In **Dealing with Real Data**, we take you through the first exploratory steps which you are likely to take when seeing new data. At the same time, we introduce various Python tools that are very useful for dealing with data. 

2. **Pandas**. Here we review some of the elementary functionality which make `pandas` the Python library of choice for manipulating spreadsheet-like databases.

3. **Linear Regression**. While linear regression may be a simple regression technique, it is also one of the most useful and widely used. We review the fundamentals of linear regression applies to a concrete problem.

4. **Logistic Regression**. While linear regression is used for continuous variables, logistic regression comes in handy for variables of a categorical nature. Go through this notebook to find out more!

5. **Decision Trees**. Decision Trees are very popular for classification tasks because of the simplicity and interpretability. In this exercise-driven notebook, we tell you all you need to know about decision trees.

6. **K Nearest Neighbours**. In this hands-on tutorial we will code our own version of the K Nearest Neighbours classifier!

7. **Random Forests**. Have you ever wondered what happens when you grow decision trees on random subsamples of your data and organize then in a decision committee? Go through this notebook to find out!

8. **Imbalanced Data**. Sometimes your data will have classes of unequal size, which can affect the performance of your classifier. In this tutorial we will show you various techniques which can be used to mitigate this problem.

9. **K Means Clustering**. Clustering refers to the task of grouping together similar objects. An intuitice algorithm to cluster data is the K Means Algorithm, which we review here.

10. **Data Visualisation**. Good visualisations help you discover new insights from your data, and help convey your resuls to others. We will show you how to create professional-looking plots using `matplotlib` and `plotly`, and how Sherlock reports help you present your data more effectively.

Have fun!
